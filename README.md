# Android NFC Location
## A repo to document all the NFC Location on an Android Device

The Problem:

No one knows where their NFC is located on their Android Device. This makes it really hard to use Android Beam or any App that uses the NFC.

The Solution:

I'm going to start documenting where the NFC location is for all Android Devices. This would make it easier for anyone to find out where their NFC location is.

## Solution

I'm planning to write the info in JSON style. This will allow people to easily search through the data. I'm still figuring out what format it should be. This might change.

Please carry out PR or Issues if you would like to contribute. Please note, I'm still deciding what license this all should be in.

## License
I'm still deciding. I'm leaning towards Apache license. I'll update this after I've decided.
